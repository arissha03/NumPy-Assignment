        "\n",
        "1. Vectorization\n",
        "Definition: Vectorization refers to the process of implementing operations on entire arrays instead of using explicit loops. In essence, it allows for applying mathematical operations to all elements in an array in a single operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "Performance Improvement: Vectorized operations are executed at a lower level (often in C) and are optimized for speed. This leads to significant performance gains compared to using Python loops, which involve more overhead.\n",

        "2. Broadcasting\n",
        "Definition: Broadcasting is a technique that allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes. It automatically expands the smaller array across the larger array in a compatible way.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it Works: Broadcasting follows a set of rules to determine how to stretch the dimensions of the smaller array to match those of the larger array:\n",
        "\n",
        "If the arrays have a different number of dimensions, the smaller array is padded with ones on the left side until they match in dimension.\n",
        "The two arrays are compatible when, for each dimension, the sizes are either the same or one of them is 1.\n",
        "The smaller array is virtually expanded to match the shape of the larger array, allowing for element-wise operations.\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility: Broadcasting allows for operations between arrays of different shapes, reducing the need for explicit resizing or reshaping of data.\n",
        "Memory Efficiency: Broadcasting avoids the need to create large temporary arrays in memory, as it operates on the original shapes of the arrays."
